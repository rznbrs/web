    <h1>Personal Health Tracking and Surgery History</h1>
    <p>Our modern healthcare app allows users to easily view old surgery records, new surgery dates, and old surgery reports. This feature helps patients understand and track their own health history. Detailed information about surgeries, doctors, and treatment plans allows users to manage their health conditions more effectively.</p>

    <h1>Prescription and Medicine Tracking</h1>
    <p>Our application allows users to view previously taken medications, prescriptions and the dates of these prescriptions in detail. Thanks to this feature, patients can monitor their treatments regularly and make informed decisions about medication use. Users can communicate more effectively with their doctors over their past prescriptions and medications and contribute to future treatment planning.</p>

    <h1>Disease and Pain Detection</h1>
    <p>Our app helps users track their health on a daily basis. Users can record instant disease symptoms and pain conditions by answering the questions specified through the application.

    <h1>Artificial Intelligence Supported Diagnosis and Recommendations</h1>
    <p>Our app provides AI-powered diagnoses and recommendations using users' health data. Users respond to app-directed questions about specific health issues, and AI uses that information to come up with possible diagnoses. This allows users to gain greater awareness of their health conditions and seek professional medical help when necessary.</p>
